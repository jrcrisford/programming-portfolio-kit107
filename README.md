## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1 – Time and Firing Solution (Java)
Implements time-based functionality and firing solution calculations using interfaces and object-oriented programming in Java. Demonstrates encapsulation, interface implementation, and basic test cases.

### Assignment 2 – Set Data Structure and Themes (C)
Implements and tests a custom Set ADT in C. Emphasizes modular programming, use of collections, nodes, and linked data structures. Includes a CLI to manage themed collections.

### Assignment 3 – Knight’s Tour Solver (C)
Solves the Knight’s Tour chess puzzle using game trees. Applies stacks, queues, and tree traversal algorithms to explore valid paths across a board. Demonstrates recursive backtracking and structured problem decomposition using C.
